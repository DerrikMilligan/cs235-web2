Please answer the questions in this text file and submit it to I-Learn.

1. Copy and paste the URL for your source code repository (e.g., GitHub):
https://github.com/DerrikMilligan/cs235-web2

3. Briefly list and describe the elements of the application that are functioning. 
- An index page / where we can add a new user
- A /users where it displays all the current users
- A /create-user page where we post a new user - redirects to /users after a successful post
- Users stored in a json file

4. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.
- None

5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.
- It was fun re learning to use require instead of import. It's been a long time since I've used it

6. If you could change this assignment to be more effective or helpful, what would you change?
- Tough call. I like the way this course is laid out so far.
- We have good video tutorials to learn stuff
- I really appreciate having a list of requirements for someone as myself who doesn't need the video tutorials so I can do the assignment without having to watch the videos.
- I like that it's somewhat freeform with how I can structure my git repo

7. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment: 5
   1 - Some attempt was made
   2 - Developing, but significantly deficient
   3 - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
   4 - Meets requirements
   *5 - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements*

8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
I added redirects to the list. Some extra anchors to work with the pages nicely, and stored the users in a json file.
